<!-- INFO -->

## :information_source: Contract Info

demo [link](https://osas2211.github.io/algo-petshop)

This Dapp provides a way for pet shops to handle their pet adoptions using the Algorand Blockchain.


- A general FEE is used for the petshop, meaning all pets can be adopted at a certain fee. 


   - This is achieved with the aid of a helper contract(application) which helps to store the data of the general fee


   - The helper function also has a feature of updating the fee as the owner of the store wishes (Note: currently this feature is made accessible to all users for testing purposes, but ideally it would only be accessible to store owner)


- User pay a fee and have a pet assigned to them, from which they can receive the pets from the shop.


- People can also choose to add their pets to the petshop
